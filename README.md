Welcome to my Business Analytics Projects! Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate my expertise in problem discovery, big data retrieval through API, data analysis, and creating interesting visualizations.

### Project 1: Tech Company Locations Analysis

### Background and Question
Where do tech companies prefer to locate? This is a crucial question for emerging firms, governments, and communities. Understanding tech hubs helps in fostering collaborative environments and shaping regional growth policies.

### Data Collection
I retrieved data using the Companies House API, focusing on specific sectors like 'Business and Domestic Software Development,' 'Information Technology Consultancy Activities,' and 'Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Activities.' The query began with companies established since 2014 that are still active. Key variables collected include company names and postcodes for geographical analysis.

### Geographic Analysis -- Heatmap Visualization

I employ a heatmap to demonstrate the concentration of tech companies in major cities like London, Birmingham, Manchester, and Bristol. For a more granular analysis:

- **London**: Covent Garden, City of London, Holborn
- **Birmingham**
- **Manchester**
- **Bristol**

The heatmap provides an interactive element, allowing users to zoom in for detailed district-level information. You can download the html file and interact with it.

### Conclusion
Understanding the distribution of tech companies can aid in strategic business decisions and policy-making. This analysis provides a foundation for identifying potential hubs and planning for future developments.

### Project 2: Tracing the Evolution of Artistic Mediums: European Art from the 17th to 20th Century

### Background and Question
Utilizing The Metropolitan Museum of Art's API, this project explores the evolution of artistic mediums over four centuries. This analysis aims to understand how changes in materials reflect broader social, technological, and aesthetic trends, focusing specifically on European art from the 17th to the 20th centuries.

### Text Analysis
Using Text Analytics techniques, it is found: 
- 17th Century: Artworks predominantly used mediums like oil paint, ink, and chalk on various surfaces such as canvas, wood, and metal, focusing on realistic representations of the world.
- 18th Century: There was a shift toward delicate materials like porcelain and soft-paste, reflecting refined aesthetic tastes likely influenced by the Industrial Revolution.
- 19th Century: A blend of traditional materials such as silk and gold with newer elements like enamel and cotton emerged, highlighting a period of significant experimentation alongside industrialization.
- 20th Century: Artists incorporated a dynamic mix of both industrial and unconventional materials, including cotton, pochoir, leather, and photographs, indicating diverse artistic movements.

<br>
Key social and technological developmentsâ€”such as the Industrial Revolution, the Age of Enlightenment, and the advent of electricityâ€”have significantly influenced the evolution of artistic mediums. These changes are crucial for informed decision-making in marketing, strategic planning, and conservation. Museums can leverage these insights to enhance visitor engagement and promote cultural appreciation effectively.

Through these two projects, I have become familiar with data analysis using APIs. Thanks to my professor, Pawel! And thank you for exploring my portfolio!ðŸ¥‚
